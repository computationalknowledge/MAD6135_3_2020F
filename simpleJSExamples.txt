that adds the numbers from 100 to 1
skip down by 7 each time
output the SUM of all the numbers you stepped over
100 + 93 + 86 + 79 

for ( a ;  ; c ){

final working version of the program: Please get this running in your environment!

//that adds the numbers from 100 to 1
//skip down by 7 each time
//output the SUM of all the numbers you stepped over

var counter = 100;
// counter++;
var animal = "LION";
animal++;
var sum = 0;
const stepDownNumber = 7;
for (; counter >= 1;) {
    sum += counter;
    counter -= stepDownNumber;
}

console.log("the sum is ", sum);

// here is the same but with WHILE 

//that adds the numbers from 100 to 1
//skip down by 7 each time
//output the SUM of all the numbers you stepped over
// this is a change make outside of vsc


var counter = 100;
// counter++;
var animal = "LION";
animal++;
var sum = 0;
const stepDownNumber = 7;
while (counter >= 1) {
    sum += counter;
    counter -= stepDownNumber;
}

console.log("the sum is ", sum);
